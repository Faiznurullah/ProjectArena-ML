# Iris Flower Classification (R Language)

This project classifies Iris Flowers into 3 categories or types of Iris's namely, versicolor,
, setosa and, virginica. This is done by  finding a pattern/correlation between species of Iris and  Sepal/ Petal length's and Width's.

## Dataset

Iris Dataset is available in-built in R studio

## Requirements

- R Language


## Usage


1. Open the Python script `Iris_RLang.r` 

2. Run the script in terminal

3. The script will analyze, visualize various aspects of the dataset and train classication machine learning algorithms.

## ML ALGORITHM

- Used Decision Tree Classifier 
- Identified redundant and less used branches
- Pruned Tree to make it less complex and the boost the speed of classification
